\# Hi! My name is Hamza and I am an impact driven software engineer in my 3rd year of studies. I am knowledgeable with Git, Docker, testing and databases. I have been using Test Driven Development principles to architect code that is easy to maintain with automated testing and CI/CD. I can comfortably work with any team size to come up with solutions to complex problems and implement them. I am currently getting my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
